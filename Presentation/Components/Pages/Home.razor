                <strong>Monthly Trade Frequency:</strong> A monthly trade frequency is a disciplined approach that allows investors to review
                and adjust their portfolios with a regular cadence. This strategy balances the need for responsiveness to market
                changes without the excessive transaction costs and potential overreaction associated with more frequent trading.

        <strong>Selection of S&P 500 and NASDAQ-100 Stocks:</strong> The S&P 500 and NASDAQ-100 are two of the most prominent stock indices
        in the United States. The S&P 500 represents a broad spectrum of the largest companies across various industries,
        while the NASDAQ-100 is heavily weighted towards technology and innovation-driven firms. By combining stocks from
        both indices, investors can achieve a diversified portfolio that captures the growth potential of tech giants
        and the stability of established corporations.

        <strong>Filtering the Best 50 Stocks by Annual Percentage Change:</strong> The initial filter in this strategy involves selecting
        the top 50 stocks based on the percentage change over the last 12 months. This criterion identifies stocks with
        strong momentum and potential for continued growth. It is a reflection of the companies’ ability to increase
        shareholder value over a significant period, which often correlates with solid financial health and competitive
        advantages in their respective industries.

        <strong>Narrowing Down to the Best 30 Stocks Over the Last 6 Months:</strong> The next step refines the selection to the 30
        best-performing stocks by percentage change over the preceding six months. This shorter timeframe provides a
        more recent performance perspective, ensuring that the chosen stocks are not only historically successful but
        also currently trending upwards. It helps to filter out stocks that may have peaked earlier in the year and
        are now showing signs of decline.

        <strong>Final Selection of the Top 10 Stocks by Quarterly Performance:</strong> The concluding phase of this strategy focuses
        on the most recent quarter, selecting the top 10 stocks by percentage change in the last three months. This
        final filter is crucial for capturing stocks with immediate upward trajectories, possibly in response to recent
        developments such as innovative product launches, favorable regulatory changes, or shifts in consumer behavior.

                <strong>Conclusion:</strong> The described investment strategy is a methodical approach that leverages the strengths of both
                the S&P 500 and NASDAQ-100 indices. By applying a series of filters based on different time horizons, it
                aims to construct a dynamic and potentially lucrative portfolio. The monthly trade frequency allows for
                regular reassessment and realignment with the investor’s goals, adapting to the ever-changing landscape of
                the stock market. As with any investment strategy, it is essential to consider the associated risks and
                conduct thorough research before making any financial decisions.

# Momentum-Trading-Strategy
This is based on a strategy recommended by Portfolios for the investor: The best strategies to invest in stocks and ETFs while controlling risk by Luca Giusti. This book is written in Italian, and I don't have an English version of this book. The strategy goes as follows:
- Trading frequency monthly.
- Select the best 50 stocks of the NASDAQ-100 by percentage change for the last 12 months.
- From the above select the best 30 stocks by percentage change in the last 6 months.
- Of the 30 stocks pick the 10 best performing by percentage change in the last 3 months.
